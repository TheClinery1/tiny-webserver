# Tiny Webserver
<p>This is going to be one of the smallest webservers available... Hopefully.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this the webserver itself is 495KiB and the command sender is another 447KiB. This server reads the config from the same folder that it's in so be sure to add the config.conf file into the running folder.</p>
